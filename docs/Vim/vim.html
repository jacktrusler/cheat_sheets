          Surprisingly (to me at least), the history of Vim starts here. Ed is the first text editor in our story, it
          was developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969. It was influenced by qed text editor, which was developed at UC
          Berkeley, Ken's alma mater. Thompson implemented regular expressions on qed, which was notable. Ed is a line
          based text editor with no GUI, just simple command line options. Start ed with a prompt:
          <span class="code">ed -p ">> "</span>
          This will start ed and add an indicator to see your cursor position. There are two modes,
          command mode, which will have your defined cursor, and input mode, which means you're actually inputing
          into the program, the ">> " will disappear in input mode.

          "," in front of commands will apply to the whole file.
          <span class="code">>>,n</span>
          Will print the whole file with line numbers for example.

          The text editor that caused us to start down this twisted (righteous?) path was called Vi, written by Bill Joy
          in 1976. This was the <b>Vi(sual)</b> mode for a line editor called <b>Ex</b>, and was released as part of the
          first Berkely Software Distribution (BSD) / Unix release in March 1978. Ex in the form shipped with Vi was
          also written by Bill Joy, but had some features influenced from Charles Haley, who modified <b>Ed</b> calling
          it <b>Em</b>.

            Ex</b> stands for extended, because it was originally an extension of the simple line editor <b

          editing mode, which was eventually added to ex.
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            &emsp;The commands Ex and Vi point to the same program, started in different modes. You can start ex by

              -v</span>. Additionally, from within Ex, you can start Vi with the <span class="code-span">visual</span>
            command (or <span class="code-span">vi</span> for short). From inside Vi, you can start Ex with the command
            <span class="code-span">Q</span>."

        <p class="section-desc">
          On top of adding a GUI, Vi introduced a whole new slew of ideas and commands to the text editing experience.
          Some of these
          came from ex, and some were for Vi itself. Also instead of editing out whole lines, you can now edit
          indivudial characters
          in the lines. There are 3 modes in Vi:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Command mode</li>
          <li>Insert mode</li>
          <li>Last Line mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-desc">
          Command mode is the mode you are in when you enter Vi, it allows you to use motions and movement commands
          <b>(hjkl)</b> to move around the page.
          Entering insert mode requires an input command in Command mode, commonly these are <b>i</b> (insert), <b>a</b>
          (append), <b>c</b> (change), <b>s</b> (substitute), <b>o</b> (open new line).
          Entering last line mode requires typing colon <b>":"</b> this allows you to use <b>Ex</b> commands.

          While many of these changes are built in, other changes are made possible by the introduction of vimscript,
          which is a built in scripting language written by Bram enabling you to run Ex and Vim commands automatically

          There is an almost endless sea of vim motions and commands, for brevity I added some that show some of the
          powerful features of Vim, and that I use often. For a more extensive list here's a <a class="section-desc"
            href="https://vim.rtorr.com/">cheat sheet of Vim commands.</a> I wouldn't recommend trying to
          memorize these, just something to give you a reference point and maybe some new ideas of
          motions or commands to try.

          Neovim was created as a community fork for Vim with the goals of making a faster, more collaborative
          and more user friendly and configurable Vim. It can basically be downloaded and run on any operating
          system and has hundreds of open source projects currently in the ecosystem.

          Here's the about on Github:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability
        </blockquote>

        <p class="section-desc">
          And here's the first paragraph of the README:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:
          <ul>
            <li>Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions</li>
            <li>Split the work between multiple developers</li>
            <li>Enable advanced UIs without modifications to the core</li>
            <li>Maximize extensibility</li>
          </ul>

          </a>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="section-desc">
          I think Neovim does a great job on delivering on all of these goals, and a large part of the reason
          is because of their decision to use Lua.
        </p>

        <span class="small-sub">What is Lua?</span>
        <p class="section-desc">
          Lua is a language created in Brazil in 1993.
          The Lua language was incorporated into Neovim for 5 main reasons.

        <p class="section-desc">
          For a text editor, these goals seem like an obvious win. Simplicity is really also key because it
          allows developers to quickly get up and running with a relatively popular and simple language instead
          of having to learn vimscript which only really has one use, which is to extend vim.

        <span class="small-sub">LSP Support</span>
        <p class="section-desc">
          What is Language Server Protocol (LSP)? Joint project between Microsoft, Redhat and Codenvy. Bascially LSP is
          a protocol for how clients should format requests to a language server. This removes the need for editors to
          implement their own language servers for every language, and instead separate concerns by having all languages
          implement certain actions as defined by the LSPs. Any editor with an LSP <i>client</i> can interact with any
          language that provides an LSP <i>server</i>.
          <br>
          <br>
          LSP removes the need for a concept implemented in Vim called tags. A program like ctags is used to create an
          index file that maps language objects, and allows these objects to be found quickly and efficiently. In LSP
          the client makes JSON remote procedure calls (RPC) with a defined procedure like goToDefinition, then the
          server sends back a response, which the client interprets and executes. If done correctly it jumps to the
          definition of the call. The language servers can provide a lot more functionality most coders have come to
          expect out of their IDE. Including autocomplete, hover definition, type declaration, implementation, auto
          formatting, variable renaming, diagnostics and more. All these things are not currently possible in Vim
          without a plugin, but full featured LSP client plugins do exist for Vim/Nvim...
          <br>
          <br>
          Why have a built in LSP client if plugins already exist? Having an LSP client built in is beneficial because
          it allows not only for the community to easily configure and build plugins in a way that takes advantage of
          LSP, but also makes a larger Lua library with more functionality that can be used for plugins that may not be
          related to LSP.

          Finding out the history of Vim was a lot of fun, hopefully this website can provide a good starting point to
          the endless (no, really) journey that is discovering Vim...
