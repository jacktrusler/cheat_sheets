          Maybe unsurprisingly, the story of vi starts here. Ed is the first text editor in our story, it was developed
          by Ken Thompson in August 1969. It was influenced by qed text editor, which was developed at UC Berkeley,
          Ken's alma mater. Thompson implemented regular expressions on qed, which was notable.
          Ed is a line based text editor with no GUI, just simple command line options.
          Start ed with a prompt:
          <span class="code">ed -p ">> "</span>
          This will start ed and add an indicator to see your cursor position. There are two modes,
          command mode, which will have your defined cursor, and input mode, which means you're actually inputing
          into the program, the ">> " will disappear in input mode.

          "," in front of commands will apply to the whole file.
          <span class="code">>>,n</span>
          Will print the whole file with line numbers for example.

          The text editor that caused us to start down this twisted (righteous?) path was called vi, written
          by Bill Joy in 1976. This was the <b>vi(sual)</b> mode for a line editor called <b>ex</b>, and was released
          as part of the first Berkely Software Distribution (BSD) / Unix release in March 1978.
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uex.htm">&emsp;"<b class="flex-inline">ex</b> stands for
          extended,
          because it was originally an extension of the simple line editor <b class="flex-inline">ed</b>. Similarly,
          "vi" stands for visual, because vi is the "visual" (full-screen) editing mode, which was eventually added to
          ex.
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            &emsp;The commands ex and vi point to the same program, started in different modes. You can start ex by
            running
            vi -e, or you can start vi by running ex -v. Additionally, from within ex, you can start vi with the visual
            command
            (or vi for short). From inside vi, you can start ex with the command Q."</p>

        <p class="section-desc">
          On top of adding a GUI, Vi introduced a whole new slew of ideas and commands to the text editing experience.
          Some of these
          came from ex, and some were for Vi itself. Also instead of editing out whole lines, you can now edit
          indivudial characters
          in the lines. There are 3 modes in Vi:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Command mode</li>
          <li>Insert mode</li>
          <li>Last Line mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-desc">
          Command mode is the mode you are in when you enter Vi, it allows you to use motions and movement commands
          <b>(hjkl)</b> to move around the page.
          Entering insert mode requires an input command in Command mode, commonly these are <b>i</b> (insert), <b>a</b>
          (append), <b>c</b> (change), <b>s</b> (substitute), <b>o</b> (open new line).
          Entering last line mode requires typing colon <b>":"</b> this allows you to use <b>Ex</b> commands.

            vi-derivative text editor that is very popular among programmers and power users. From July 2006 until

          Vim is massively different from Vi, it has a much larger (like seriously there's so many new features) depth
          of new
          functionality, so much that i'm going to miss probably 90% of it, but here are some of the major differences:

        <ul class="list">
          <li>USER INTERFACE -- buffers / windows / tabs </li>
          <li>MODES -- normal / insert / visual / terminal / command</li>
          <li>COLORS -- Syntax highlighting / themes</li>
          <li>GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY -- jump list / registers / undo history / code folding</li>
          <li>MOTIONS -- new combinations introduced to move around the page and edit text</li>
          <li>KEYMAPS -- customizable ways to automate your vim experience</li>
          <li>PLUGINS -- the true next level of Vim written by users</li>
