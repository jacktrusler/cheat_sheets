![Free BSD](./svgs/freeBSD.svg "Free BSD")
*You can't spell based without BSD*

## Why BSD
Brought to you by the boys (and girls) at Berkley, the Berkley Software Distribution. For Free! 

Unix based OS, shares a general schmood with Linux.

    ssh-copy-id -i ed_25519.pub <host>@<domain>  
    dnf update
    chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

## Important directories
`man hier` for a quick look at important directories.
A lot of stuff gets downloaded into the `/usr/` directory

    /usr/local/etc   (kinda similar to etc in linux)

### Misc
`ls -G` to colorize your directories
